met with the management to talk about the database and the type of project that they needed built.

worked on excalidraw and mapped out the bare bones of the project. See below: 


11.7.2023
I worked a lot the past month. I was able to set up the frontend and backend.
I set up routers for all of the endpoints and protected the relevant endpoints with authorization.
For the past month I've been learning how to deploy the application using AWS. I've now set up the 
application by using ECS Fargate and made it available using a load balancer. Today I updated the 
wire frame image. I also was able to finish the set up for the load balancer and I will be looking
into getting a top level domain name (TLDN) for an SSL certification and then update the HTTP to 
HTTPS.

11.10.2023
I was able to fully deploy the FormSubmission table on AWS and will be working on the rest of the 
pages. I will start to work on wire framing what I think the pages should look like and then run 
them by Pam. 

11.14.2023 I have been able to update the authorization to http cookies only. Now the site can be
refreshed and the authorization will persist. I've updated and protected each of the sites and now
only the FormSubmission will be available to unauthorized users (apart from the login page).
